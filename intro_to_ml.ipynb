    "> Machine learning is a process of building a program that has the ability to \"learn\" without being explcity programmed. An iterative approach allows the program to optimize specific parameters by running through training data, such that it will be able make insights on new data (data not part of the training set)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Machine learning can be used to solve many types of problems including supervised and unsupervised tasks. In a supervised tasks, the training data you feed the algorithm inlcudes the desired solutions, called labels. The model will learn how to predict these labels or target values.\n",
    ">> In supervised classification the program gets instances (instance is one piece of data) and predicts a class or the group that it belongs to, such as classifying an email as spam. Supervised regression predicts a number or value for each instance. In this guide I'll walk you through a regressions model that predicts housing prices based on various fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An unsupervised task in contrast does not receive the desired outputs when training. Common unsupervised tasks include:\n",
    ">> Clustering, where the model puts instances into groups; anomaly and novelty detection, where the model predicts whether an instance belongs into a group; and dimensionality reductions, a method of simplifying datasets to better train other models."

    "# **Importing the Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> After the problem has been identified, the first step to building a machine learning model is aquiring the data. A portion of the data will go towards training the model (the training set), and another portion will go towards evaluating the model after it‘s been trained (called the test set). It's important to keep these separated. If you test the model on data that was used to train the model you may receive an unrealistic estimate of how well the model performs. We want to know how well our model generalizes, and not how well it does on our subset of data. \n",

    ">To train a machine learning model you have to send data through the algorithm. However, multiple steps occur before this, and more often are the more time consuming stpes. For example, data may go through a standardizer to help scale the data, or go through a class to correct missing values. When steps like this are used, they must be applied to each stage of learning, including training and testing. If training data is prepared one way, and testing data is prepared another way, the model will not know how to predict values for the different testing data, and it will give poor results. In order to automate these preprocessing steps for each stage of learning, a pipeline is created. A pipeline, supported by the scikit learn library, connects multiple steps together so that data can be sent through all the steps with one call."

    ">Using metrics for scoring helps identify how the model is performing. The metric may measure the accuracy of a classification problem, the average error for a regression problem, or any other metric that may be suited for te problem. When working on machine learning problems, a test set is kept separate from the training data. A concern when training models is the potential to overfit training data, that is, learn patterns of the training data that doesn't generalize to the population of data. By keeping a test dataset separate, it can help score how the model generalizes to real world data."

That being said, the way that one goes about this varies from project to project and there really is no one way to do something. It takes experimentation to find the best preprocessing steps for the data, and then it takes experimentation to build the best model with the best hyperparameters. \n",
